# S.W.A.R.M
A simple Multicopter with the Function that it can walk like a Spider.

The Idea
---------

You got a Client for Windows Android or Linux(Mac is not planed right now) the Plan is that you can controll your SWARM from anywhere and that it change between Spider and Multicopter mode.

A Fly together Mode in that you can Fly together with other Drones The Drones will connect to an SWARM They share Information about the Fly and Akku etc. to fly together in autopilot maybe.
Structure
----------

-SWARM Client	The Client is on your device(Windows,Linux,Android) you can control the SWARM from anywhere
-SWARM Modes:	The Spider Mode is for walking in this mode the propellers turn off and the 3 Servos per Lag (6 Lags) going on.
				The Multicoper Mode is for Flying In this mode The Servos going on the neutral position and sty like that, in the same time the propeller start to work and bring the drone in the air.
-SWARM Sensors: SWARM will got an Autopilot for longer Distances and need some Ultrasonic Sensor a Camera for Live streaming and with the Additional slot on the Drone we give you the chance to personalize your Drone with some Sensors or Action Stuff and things.
